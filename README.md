## Monorepo structure

### apps
That were all the "final products" are available, like website, Api, testing, ect...
If it **can** run on it's own, it's here.

### lib
That were all the "libraries" are available, like components, services, ect...
If it **can't** run on it's own, it's here.

### Tools
I have no idea what to put here, but I'm sure I'll find something.
