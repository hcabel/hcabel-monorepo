# HugoMeet Signalling Server

## Description
This is the server that connect all the clients together from my meeting platform ["hugomeet"](https://github.com/hcabel/hcabel-monorepo/tree/DEV/apps/frontend/hugomeet)

It's actually pretty old but it's working and I learn a lot doing it (but I wouldn't do it like that anymore XD)
