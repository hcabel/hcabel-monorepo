# Project API

## Description
This API is for caching data from my project, like youtube view of each video, or the number of people who have fork or stared my repos, or the number of people who downloaded my extension, etc.

## Why ?!
Because external API want me to pay for those PUBLIC data so I decided to create a python script that will fetch all those data and store them in my database.
So I can read them has much has I want and I don't have to pay for it.
(It's updated every day)

## This API support internationalization i18n !
It's pretty cool because you can get the data in your language (at least if you speak english or french)
