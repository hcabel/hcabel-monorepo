# Telemetry API

## Description
This is where all the tracking data from my app go through.

#### Note:
It's for my own learning purpose, **no data are sell** (I dont know how anyway), and if you though that those data were not collected anyway, you are saldy mistaken, I can't do anything about it, so I might as well use it for my own learning purpose.

For now I do nothing with the data, I just look at the raw database to see if people are using my app.
But it's pretty terrible to look at, so I'm might work on a dashboard to make it more readable one day (maybe).
