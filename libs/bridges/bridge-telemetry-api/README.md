# Bridge Telemetry API

## Description
This is where all the request to the [telemetry API](https://github.com/hcabel/hcabel-monorepo/tree/DEV/apps/backend/telemetry-api) are created with the right routes and interfaces.
So you dont have to worry about the API, just call the function `CreateVisit` with the right parameters, and it will do the rest.
